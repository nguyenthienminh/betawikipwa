# PWAs I've made
Those are made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Made with the tutorial from https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-pwa-from-scratch-with-html-css-and-javascript/ and https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/index.php

# How did you do this?
Well, I use a full screen iframe on those websites, so it had the full experience. Next, the home page is actually built using Bootstrap 5, the newest version. Check the guide to do this above.

# But, why? Some of those websites are already PWAs.
Yes, I could agree. Some of those are already PWAs, but those websites... I kind of remastered them a little bit. The original version(s) is basically bookmarks or looks like a native app, but the icons are pretty broken. So, the remastered version(s) is the same as the original... with a slight difference, which is I fixed all of those issues so it looks like a native app more.
